### Project overview
Object detection is one of the most important tasks of self-driving cars which are required to understand sorrounding environments and properly navigate with safety.

In this project, I try to train a model which detects typical traffic participants, namely vehicles, pdestrians and cyclists, from images taken in a variety of environments. Starting with a pre-trained model, I experiment with some hyper parameters and image augmentations to examine how they affect the model performance.

It is a critical step of training a ML model to sufficiently understand data to be used. Therefore I perform a thorough EDA in advance of the training.

### Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
#### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.
